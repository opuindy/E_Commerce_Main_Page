## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [useReducer and Context-Api] - For State Management
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned
This was my first time attempting a beginner project like this.
I learnt the basic use of the use reducer and context-api in state management.

### Continued development

Would love if anyone can review the code and suggest some steps to improve my self. Also I would continue to study to increase my comfortability using the style components, useReducer and Context-api
